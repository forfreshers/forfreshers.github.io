## Navigation

Most commands you run in terminal are going to involve a path to a specific file or directory but you won't always know where what you're looking for is so you often need to navigate your filesystem to seek out a file.

| pwd       | Shows you the path of the working directory| pwd                      |
| ls        | Lists contents of current directory or prov| ls sites                 |



## Creation

Creating files and folders is a breeze using the command line, just a few commands can flesh out a new project structure, say goodbye to right clicking in finder or your IDE.

| Command   | Summary                |Example             |
| --------- |:--------------------- :|:------------------:|
| touch     | Creates a file         | touch index.html   |
| mkdir     | Creates a directory    | mkdir assets       |




## Move, Copy, Rename

Dragging and dropping files in the wrong place by mistake happens to me more than I care to admit but because these commands specify a path you can be sure you always know where they came from and where they're going.

| Command   | Summary                                | Example                                  |
| --------- |:------------------------------------- :|:----------------------------------------:|
| mv        | Moves a file or changes its name.      | mv file1.txt dir2/file2.txt              |
| cp        | Copies from one location to another.   | cp documents/file.txt desktop/file.txt   |

## Git

Git is one of the most important tools for a developer as it enables you to version control and collaborate with other developers effectively. I'm not going to rant about why you should be using git here but it is hands down he most crucial tool to manage code as a front end developer.

The most common way to interact with git is to install and use the cli, the most common commands are:

| Command         | Summary                                                 |
| --------------- |:------------------------------------------------------ :|
| git clone       | Clone an existing repository.                           |
| git init        | Initialise the working directory as a git project.      |
| git add         | Add files to staging area.                              |
| git commit -m   | Commit the staged files to the branch with a message.   |
| git push        | Push commits to the remote branch.                      |
| git status      | Display current directory state and staging area.       |
| git log         | Displays the commit log.                                |

## Yarn

Yarn is a dependancy management tool built on top of npm which stands for "node package manager". As the name suggests it manages packages of javascript code that your project depends on.
Yarn is faster and better at managing dependancies across different environments and is an "out of the box" replacement for npm.

| Command         | Summary                                                 |
| --------------- |:------------------------------------------------------ :|
| yarn init       | Interactively creates or updates a package.json file.   |
| yarn install    | Installs dependancies.                                  |
| yarn add        | Adds a dependancy on a package.                         |
| yarn remove     | Removes a dependancy on a package.                      |
| yarn upgrade    | Updates a dependancy.                                   |
| yarn run        | Runs a defined package script.                          |
